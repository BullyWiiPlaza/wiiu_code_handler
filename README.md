## What is this?
This is a work-in-progress C implementation of a Wii U cheat code handler like [the one made by CosmoCortney](http://cosmocortney.ddns.net/enzy/cafe_code_types_en.php).

## How do I compile this?
Import this project with [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/) via the `VCS` -> `Checkout from Version Control` -> `GitHub` menu bar options.

On most Linux distributions, this should compile and execute right away but on `Windows` you need to install and configure `CLion` for [`Cygwin`](https://cygwin.com/install.html) with at least the following packages:
* gcc-g++
* make
* gdb

For step-by-step instructions, you may refer to the [CLion configuration guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html).
